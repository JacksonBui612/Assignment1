									<h2>Interest in IT</h2>
									<p>My interest in IT is the way how it changes the world, specifically the way it helps people to work efficiently and make our life easier. To be honest, I started to feel interested when I was in my gap year after highschool. At that time, my brother gave me some advice and suggestions about my future career and he did mention about IT which is the most popular and well-paid job. However, I was still confused between IT and International Business. Then my brother bought me a macbook pro and I found it very fun and easy to use. I can connect it with my iphone, ipad and ipod. The connection is very perfect and after that, I decided to do a research about IT and I knew that it had many fields. .</p>
									<p>Well at first i was in another university but the facilities and the syllabus were not so good and attractive so I decided to choose RMIT. After taking some English courses, I become much more communicative and have many good friends there. So I could say that RMIT is a good place to study and develop my skills.</p>
									<p>Honestly, I hope that during the studies, I will learn more about how the technology functions properly and what connects them together. I do really want to learn new things and meet new friends. It would be a big help for me in the future.</P>

									<h2>Ideal Job</h2>
									<p>I believe that IT Project Manager is my ideal job. This may require several years of experience before I can become a PM. There are many positions that I may have to take including Developer and Programmer Analyst before becoming a Project Manager. So Project Manager’s work is to manage software development project including but not limited to project planning, project budgeting, resource management, risk management, quality management. Tracking the progress of the project and reporting to clients and stakeholders. Communicating with people in the project and customers to understand customer’s requirements. I could say that this job is very suitable for me because I am very good at planning things and managing time. But the most important thing is that I can bring people together and understand them well.</p>
									<p>In order to apply for this position, there are many skills that I need to have including interpersonal skills, problem solving skills, technical skills, organizational skills and leadership. Furthermore, the qualifications that this job requires is certification in project management, either as a substitute for a degree in project management, or as an additional credential. In addition, I may need to have 3 to 5 years of experience before becoming a PM.</p>
									<p>For now, I have good communication skills, the ability to lead and motivate a team and I also can manage people well with their abilities. To be honest, I have done many group projects while studying English at RMIT and I used to make a gaming competition  when I was in highschool so I think I have a lot of experience in managing.</p>
									<p>In order to obtain skills, qualifications and experience required for this job, I have to change my schedule. The first thing is to achieve a work-life balance, I will have to determine what is crucial and focus on that. Secondly, I need to allocate time reasonably which means that I will make a list of things that need to be done in a day. Furthermore, I need to go to class daily to gain more knowledge and regroup when I slow down. Finally, besides learning in class, I have to do a lot of research about my job and practice skills by myself. However, I believe the most important thing is patience and effort.</p>

							<h2>Summary and Features of project</h2>
							<p>+ Nowadays, with the increasing number of products in the market, it is very important to promote products and meet the users' needs. In Vietnam, there is a lot of e-commerce site including Shopee, Tiki, LazadaVn or FPT Shop where customers can buy things easily. However, the number of products is still limited. So my project is about an e-commerce site called '' FastGoods" which connects to every supermarket and seller in Vietnam to help customers find things they want to buy quickly without going anywhere.</p>
							<p>+ More than millions of people buying things through e-commerce sites day by day because most of them do not have much time for shopping. Especially when people have to go to the supermarket every week to buy food and goods, they are more likely to consider it as a demand than a hobby. Therefore, FastGoods can be a good idea to solve this problem as it can use your location to recommend you some supermarket nearby  and the users can collect the goods they want and pay by credit card or through PayPal. It would be much easier for anyone who wants to save time for shopping.</p>
